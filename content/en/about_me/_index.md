title: "About me"
---

Without exaggeration, I would like to talk about the obstacles in my life:

- I have been living with my mental illness for many years. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (ICD-10: F25.1, schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. In DSM-5, this corresponds to 295.70). External circumstances and relationships with people often act as catalysts for worsening my condition.

- Over the past year, I have been experiencing severe financial difficulties. Because of this, I regularly have to save money on medication and food.

- At the moment, I have no close people around me. The only things keeping me from deteriorating in loneliness are the fact that I live in a dormitory and that I have to work hard (two jobs and studying).

I want you to know that regardless of whether anyone supports me or not, I will continue working on this project despite financial difficulties, mental illness, or loneliness.  
Because I want to leave something behind besides bad memories and disappointment for those who were once close to me.  
However, if you choose to support me financially, it will help me manage my debts, maintain proper nutrition, and continue my treatment.
