title: "About Me"

It doesnâ€™t really matter who I am, but I want to clarify that I am working on this project despite chronic illnesses, the most significant of which is schizoaffective disorder.  

Why did I mention this? Because I want to show that even with such difficulties, it is possible to create something useful and/or beautiful.  
I hope my case can serve as an inspiring example for everyone.  

If you decide to support me financially (which would be very helpful, as medication is very expensive), here are my details:

It is important to me that users provide feedback on my lessons.  
Unfortunately, I cannot make everything perfect on the first try.
