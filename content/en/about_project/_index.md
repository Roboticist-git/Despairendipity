**Despairendipity** is a neologism derived from the combination of two English words: *despair* (hopelessness) and *serendipity* (a fortunate accident, an unexpected lucky discovery).  
The meaning I embed in this term:

- A moment when, in deep despair, an individual experiencing intense emotional suffering has a sudden insight or inspiration born from this pain. In a world where things may not go as planned, chaos and personal tragedies can give rise to unexpected and valuable moments.
- The idea that major breakthroughs, discoveries, and insights often come not from comfort, but through pain, crises, and internal struggles.

## Why?

My goal is to create a resource with lessons on the school mathematics curriculum that is accessible to everyone.  
Mathematics is something I have some understanding of, and teaching is a way I can help people. Here, I will cover topics from school programs, analyze exam and olympiad problems from various countries. The number of lessons will gradually increase, and I will work on them as time allows—currently, my capabilities are limited (see the "About Me" section).

## About the Project Materials

All lessons are created by me voluntarily and are **completely free** from beginning to end.  
Lessons may contain animations, images, or other media content—most of which I create myself, but some may be sourced from open resources.  
Although the project is free, I still hope that some people will be willing to support my efforts.  
I ask everyone reading this to visit the "[About Me](about_me.md)" section.  
There, you can find more information about the author, how you can help, and contact details.

## Website Structure

I would like to note that for the website template (appearance, rendering, program code), I used an existing Hugo theme developed by [Sergey Slotin](http://sereja.me/) from his site [algorithmica](https://en.algorithmica.org/).  
I made modifications to the base theme to ensure future multilingual support for the project (as of February 2025, the project supports three languages) and to enhance the visual presentation of materials.  
For anyone interested in competitive programming and proficient in English (or Russian), I **strongly recommend** studying [algorithmica.org](https://en.algorithmica.org/).

## Future Plans

- Create as many lessons as possible
- Gradually add support for other languages
- Establish feedback with the target audience to improve lesson quality and gain access to real exam problems (from past years!) and olympiads from different countries
